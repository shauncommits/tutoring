                    <img src="img1.png" alt="">
                    <p>Have a homework planner at all times. Sumbmitting homework, projects, tests and assignments as soon as they are assigned will make sure you do not forget about them.</p>

                    <img src="img2.png" alt="">
                    <p>It's important to concentrate and avoid distractions when the teacher is speaking. Practice active listening by concentrating on what's being said and taking notes in your own words. This will help make sure you hear (and understand) what is being taught in class.</p>

                    <img src="img3.png" alt="">
                    <p>Distractions are everywhere—from cell phones to social media to friends. Be aware of what distracts you in class and know how to steer clear of these distractions. Avoid sitting next to friends if you know they will distract you. Turning off your cell phone will also help make sure you are paying attention to your teacher.</p>

                    <p>Writing clear and complete notes in class will help you process the information you are learning. These notes will also become study notes that can be reviewed before a test. Talk to friends or the teacher if you have missed a class to ensure your notes are complete.</p>

                    <p>Raise your hand and ask questions if you don’t understand something. If you don’t feel comfortable asking in front of everyone, write yourself a reminder to talk to the teacher after class.</p>

                    <p>When making a study schedule, look at your planner and think about what needs to be accomplished. Think about the types of questions that will be on the test and the topics that will be covered so you know what you should focus on. Set specific goals for each study session, like how many topics you will cover by the end of the session.</p>

                    <p>The best study spot is one that is quiet, well-lit, and in a low-traffic area. Make sure there is a clear workspace to study and write on. Everyone’s needs are different, so it is important you find a spot that works for you.</p>
